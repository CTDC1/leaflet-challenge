# leaflet-challenge

This repo contains a Leaflet Map of the M1.0+ earthquakes worldwide in the last seven days. 

Using USGS data from their website, we displayed it on a Leaflet GeoJson Map. 

On the map, the following data is shown,
-	Each circle is a different earthquake with a measurement of M1.0+.
-	The size of the circles depicts the strength of the earthquake.
-	The depth of the color is depicted using different colors. 
o	Green is closer to the surface, and red is deeper.
